A portable business define language. Write your business into a one place, porting your business upon the distributed world.

## Core Concept

Recent years we saw a new concept become more and more popular, that concept called `Full Stack Engineer`. It means one Engineer handing all things, build a Web Site or a Mobile App by one person's two hands. That person must know every details from the Persistence Layer to the GUI, from the DevOps to the CSS, there too many knowledges need to leran. 

Let us back to the origin of the idea, we think it is "How make your business online at minimum cost". Of course, pay salary to one person (not a team), put all knowledges into that person's brain, it's looks like a kind of solution. But we trying another better way to resolve it, to invent a Portable Business Define Language.

That Language is a kind of Template Language, that could easy to define all your needs from the Persistence Layer to the GUI. That could easy to porting your business upon the distributed world, you don't need understand any knowledges such like DevOps ...

Finally, we trying to reducing all duplicate costs into one Language, make your business online at minimum cost.
